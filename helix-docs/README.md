# Helix Docs

Documentation home for the Helix Privacy Suite. Start here to capture architecture, PRDs, threat models, and onboarding before major code changes land.

## Must-have docs
- `heritage.md`: credits and lineage from HelixOS (Apache-2.0).
- `architecture/`: high-level diagrams for phone, desktop, and bridge.
- `policy/`: domain model, enforcement points, and default rules.
- `threat-model/`: STRIDE-style coverage for phone, desktop, and bridge links.
- `ops/`: build, release, and incident response procedures.

## Licensing notes
- Keep Apache 2.0 `LICENSE` and an updated `NOTICE` in this repo.
- When copying any material, retain upstream notices and add your own.
